# tw-head-inference-env.sh — how to reach the model endpoint, on the HEAD node.
#
# Lives at ~/tw-head-inference-env.sh. Created in §14.3a.
#
# 📌 NOTHING HAS TO BE HOOKED UP. ~/tw-head-env.sh — the entry point, on the
# head since §5.1 — already looks for this exact name, and ~/.bashrc sources
# that. Writing the file IS the installation step. That is the whole reason the
# entry point lists its dependants by name rather than each file chaining to
# the next: before this split, §14 had to edit §10's file, which was hooked
# into §5's, and the only way to know what a login shell loaded was to open
# three files in order.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. GW, GWPORT and HOST are shell variables, so every
# reconnect drops them — and an empty one fails in a way that names nothing:
#
#     curl http://:/v1/chat/completions      → exits in 8 ms, no error
#     curl -H "Host: "                        → 404 from Envoy
#
# Both read as a broken cluster. They are an empty variable, and the first
# does not even look like a failure: it looks like a very fast success.
#
# WHY FUNCTIONS RATHER THAN EXPORTS. Unlike TALOSCONFIG, these three are
# DISCOVERED, not chosen, and any of them can change without you doing
# anything:
#
#   GW      a node IP from the Gateway's status. Changes with the node set
#   GWPORT  a NodePort in 30000-32767. Reassigned if the Envoy Service is
#           ever recreated — which happens if the EnvoyProxy changes
#   HOST    from the HTTPRoute, so it is per-model and per-namespace
#
# Freezing them into a static file would give you three plausible values
# that are quietly wrong after any of those events, which is worse than
# having none. So this file re-derives them instead.

# tw_infer [inferenceservice] [namespace]
#   Derive and export GW, GWPORT, HOST and MODEL. Defaults to §14's model.
